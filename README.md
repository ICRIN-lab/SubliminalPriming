# Subliminal_Priming

Priming is a phenomenon in which exposure to one stimulus influences how a person responds to a subsequent, related stimulus. These stimuli are often conceptually related words or images.
Subliminal priming occurs when an individual is exposed to stimuli below the threshold of perception. This process occurs outside the realm of consciousness and is different from memory which relies on direct retrieval of information.

In cognitive psychology, visual backward masking involves presenting one visual stimulus (a "mask" or "masking stimulus") immediately after a brief (usually 30 ms) "target" visual stimulus resulting in a failure to consciously perceive the first stimulus. It is widely used in psychophysiological studies on fear and phobias that investigate the preattentive nonconscious reactions to fear-relevant stimuli.
